---

## **2. Which of the following is a primary goal of the Design-by-Contract method?**
- [ ] Fast program execution  
- [ ] Local error handling in the GUI  
- [ ] Reduction of interfaces  
- [ ] Local verification of software correctness  

---

## **3. What best describes an "explicit interface"?**
- [ ] An interface with no implementations  
- [ ] An interface used by only one module  
- [ ] An interface that exclusively exposes class attributes  
- [ ] A clear communication between modules through interface specifications  

---

## **4. What is the main problem with global mutable state?**
- [ ] It requires too much memory  
- [ ] It cannot be used in distributed systems  
- [ ] Variables cannot be reused  
- [ ] Implicit dependencies arise between components  

---

## **5. What is a precondition in Design-by-Contract?**
- [ ] A condition that is guaranteed to be fulfilled after execution  
- [ ] A behavior that only the implementer needs to know  
- [ ] A check that is ignored during runtime  
- [ ] A condition that must be met before executing a method  

---

## **6. Which is one of the five rules of modularity?**
- [ ] Use of global interfaces  
- [ ] Disclosure of all implementation details  
- [ ] Use of large, universal modules  
- [ ] Reduced dependencies between modules  

---

## **7. Which statement applies to postconditions?**
- [ ] They describe valid inputs for a method  
- [ ] They free the implementor from all obligations  
- [ ] They only concern static code analyses  
- [ ] They guarantee specific return values or states after execution  

---

## **8. What is the main idea behind "information hiding"?**
- [ ] Make all methods of a class public  
- [ ] Increase the size of a module  
- [ ] Make interfaces as broad as possible  
- [ ] Hide implementation details from the user  

---

## **9. Why is it important to control side effects?**
- [ ] It improves memory management  
- [ ] It increases code complexity  
- [ ] It allows more global access  
- [ ] It makes testing and code reuse easier  

---

## **10. What are invariants in Design-by-Contract?**
- [ ] Conditions that are checked only at runtime  
- [ ] Rules that apply only once  
- [ ] Error states that can occur after execution  
- [ ] Conditions that must hold true throughout the lifetime of an object

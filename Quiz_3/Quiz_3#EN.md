## Question 1  
What is an effect in programming?  
- [ ] A purely mathematical expression  
- [ ] A change or dependency on the context  
- [ ] A type of code comment  
- [ ] A fully deterministic process  

---

## Question 2  
Which of the following statements describes a pure function?  
- [ ] It modifies the global state.  
- [ ] It depends on the system time.  
- [ ] It throws exceptions.  
- [ ] It depends only on its inputs and has no side effects.  

---

## Question 3  
What is an example of a side effect?  
- [ ] A recursive function  
- [ ] Changing a global state  
- [ ] A computation like \( 1 + 2 \)  
- [ ] A constant like \( 42 \)

## Question 4  
What does referential transparency mean?  
- [ ] An expression can be replaced by its value without changing the program.  
- [ ] The value of an expression depends on the system time.  
- [ ] An expression changes its value based on its position in the code.  
- [ ] An expression modifies external states.  

---

## Question 5  
Which strategy helps minimize global mutable states?  
- [ ] Sharing state between functions.  
- [ ] Passing data as arguments and returning results.  
- [ ] Defining all variables globally.  
- [ ] Using a shared memory for variables.  

---

## Question 6  
What code smell is caused by long methods?  
- [ ] Redundancy  
- [ ] Low readability and understandability  
- [ ] Unnecessary modularity  
- [ ] Missing comments  

---

## Question 7  
What is a typical example of a "Duplication" code smell?  
- [ ] Copy-pasting code with minimal changes  
- [ ] Using functions with many parameters  
- [ ] Using global variables  
- [ ] Lack of tests  

---

## Question 8  
How can code duplication be effectively reduced?  
- [ ] By adding comments  
- [ ] By extracting common parts into functions  
- [ ] By increasing the number of variables  
- [ ] By using magic numbers

## Question 9  
What is an advantage of immutable data structures?  
- [ ] They simplify understanding and debugging of programs.  
- [ ] They are always more efficient than mutable data structures.  
- [ ] They require less memory.  
- [ ] They prevent all types of errors.  

---

## Question 10  
What describes the concept of idempotence?  
- [ ] A function returns a different result every time.  
- [ ] An effect occurs only once.  
- [ ] The state of a system is never changed.  
- [ ] Repeated calls to an effect result in the same observations as a single call.
